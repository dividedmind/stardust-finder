- (pre)process in separate thread
- GUI polishing
- removing stale template functions
- turning crosshair off (or, even better, altering opacity)
- proper (esp. network) error handling

  - consider either adding keepalive to connectors or deleting them
    (and associated images) automatically
  - should check session validity before displaying image
- show deviation instead of raw data
