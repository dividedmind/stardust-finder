- sane window state when starting up
- proper cleaning up between modes
- (pre)process in separate thread
- GUI polishing
- removing stale template functions

  (a stack)
  - this needs a stack of images (with associated connectors)
  - consider either adding keepalive to connectors or deleting them
    (and associated images) automatically
  - should check session validity before displaying image
